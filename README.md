# tutorial-chinchay-api

This tutorial will walk you through building your first API with Chinchay! It will not only be a RESTful API but we will also configure our middleware and access to filter which user can access which resources. Check [Chinchay Documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chinchay) for more information.
